# Address Book Application
This project was created throughout the Software Engineering Lab course (SYSC 4806) at Carleton University.

This application uses the Spring Boot framework and Maven tooling. It simulates the functionality of Yellow Pages,
in that it allows the user to create many Yellow Pages books and add contacts to them.
